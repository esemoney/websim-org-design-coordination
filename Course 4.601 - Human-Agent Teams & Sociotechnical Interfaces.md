# Course 4.601: Human-Agent Teams & Sociotechnical Interfaces

## Overview

This course explores the design, development, and impact of sociotechnical systems — technologies that enable and shape interactions between humans and artificial agents. As AI systems become more advanced, it is crucial to study how humans and machines can collaborate effectively as teams.

Topics covered include:

- The sociotechnical interface: points of interaction between humans and AI agents
- Design principles for effective human-agent collaboration interfaces
- Technological and societal challenges in human-AI teaming
- Case studies of real-world human-agent teams
- Emerging trends and future directions

## Course Goals

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Analyze the design of human-agent collaboration systems using key concepts from human-computer interaction, social psychology, and AI
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of current approaches to human-AI teaming
- Propose design improvements for sociotechnical systems to enable more effective human-agent collaboration
- Critically discuss the societal implications of increased human-AI collaboration in various domains

## Prerequisites

- [Course 2.700](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/course-2.700): Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction
- [Course 6.034](https://mcoai.dplmi.mit.edu/course-6.034): Artificial Intelligence

Familiarity with basic concepts in AI, HCI, and psychology will be helpful. Programming experience is not required.
