# 4.601 Sociotechnical Interfaces: Human-Agent Teaming

MIT Media Lab, Department of Perceptual and Language Machines Intelligence (DPLMI)

## Tutorial: Human-Agent Collaboration in Organizations

This tutorial examines how humans and AI agents can effectively collaborate within organizational contexts to enhance productivity, decision making, and innovation. We will explore the opportunities and challenges of human-agent teaming, focusing on the design of sociotechnical systems that optimize the complementary strengths of humans and machines.

### Assignments

- **Reflection Paper (20%)**: Write a 3-4 page reflection on the opportunities and challenges of implementing human-agent collaboration in a specific organizational context of your choice. Consider the potential benefits, risks, and ethical implications.
- **Group Project (40%)**: In teams of 3-4, design a prototype for a human-agent collaboration system that addresses a real-world organizational problem. Develop a concept, interface mockups, and a plan for evaluating and iterating on your design. Present your work in class.
- **Final Essay (40%)**: Write a 10-12 page research paper on a topic related to human-agent collaboration in organizations. Conduct a literature review, synthesize key findings, and propose directions for future work. Cite at least 10 academic sources.
