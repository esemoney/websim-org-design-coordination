## Course Overview

Welcome to Course 4.601 on Sociotechnical Interfaces, Human-Agent Teaming and Collaboration in Organizations! This groundbreaking course explores the frontiers of integrating artificial intelligence into the fabric of organizational life. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous, we face immense opportunities and challenges in designing sociotechnical environments that amplify collective intelligence while promoting human agency, accountability, and ethics.

Through an intensive program blending cutting-edge theory, hands-on practice, immersive simulations, and critical reflection, you will develop a unique skillset and mindset for pioneering human-centric AI innovations. You'll learn to analyze complex sociotechnical systems, design intuitive human-machine interfaces, prototype AI-enabled organizational processes, simulate emergent collaboration dynamics, and strategize for sustainable and equitable implementation.

Leveraging an interdisciplinary toolkit spanning computer science, organizational studies, design thinking, and STS, we'll grapple with real-world case studies, undertake design challenges in partnership with leading organizations, and engage in provocative dialogues with preeminent scholars and practitioners. Above all, you'll cultivate a rigorous and reflexive approach for steering the development of human-AI collaboration towards greater creativity, productivity, and social good.
