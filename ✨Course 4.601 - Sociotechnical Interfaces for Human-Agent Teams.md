# Course 4.601: Sociotechnical Interfaces for Human-Agent Teams

This course explores the sociotechnical aspects of human-AI collaboration, focusing on designing effective user interfaces and interaction paradigms for human-agent teams. Students will learn to consider the social, organizational and human factors involved in integrating AI agents into human workflows and decision making processes.

## Course Description

As artificial intelligence systems become more advanced and ubiquitous, there is a growing need to design effective interfaces and interaction paradigms that enable humans and AI agents to work together as teammates. This course will provide students with a sociotechnical perspective on human-agent collaboration, considering the social, organizational, and human factors involved in integrating AI into human decision making and workflows.

Students will learn to analyze use cases for human-agent teaming and design interfaces and experiences that promote effective collaboration, shared situational awareness, and appropriate reliance on automation. The course will cover topics such as mixed-initiative interaction, adjustable autonomy, explanainable AI, and AI-mediated human collaboration. Case studies will be drawn from domains such as healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, creative work, and entertainment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Analyze human-agent collaboration scenarios using sociotechnical systems theory
- Apply human-centered design methods to prototype user interfaces for human-agent teams
- Evaluate and iterate on interface designs based on user feedback and observational studies
- Implement software frameworks and interaction patterns for human-agent collaboration
- Assess the impact of AI-mediated collaboration on team dynamics and performance

## Topics Covered

- Sociotechnical systems theory and human-centered design
- Foundations of human-agent interaction and collaboration
