As AI agents become more intelligent and capable, designing effective interfaces for human-agent coordination becomes increasingly important. This involves considering factors like organizational design theory, smart mobs, decentralized coordination, human-robot interaction, and shared autonomy. By examining case studies and examples like Discord voting systems, Napster's UX, and military UAV control interfaces, we can extract design patterns and compile key resources to inform the development of next-generation human-agent coordination interfaces.

## Case Studies

### Discord Voting Systems

Discord servers often use voting and polling bots to facilitate community decision making. Analyzing the UX patterns of these systems can provide insight into designing interfaces for decentralized, agent-mediated coordination.

### Napster's Peer-to-Peer UI

Napster was a pioneering peer-to-peer file sharing service. Its interface design enabled a new form of decentralized resource coordination between a network of users and autonomous agents.

### Military UAV Control Interfaces

The interfaces used by UAV operators to control semi-autonomous drones demonstrate key principles of human-agent shared autonomy and supervisory control.
