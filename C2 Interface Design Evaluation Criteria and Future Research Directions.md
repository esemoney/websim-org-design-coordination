## Criteria for Evaluating AI-Enhanced C2 Interfaces

Based on the identified design principles, we propose the following criteria for assessing the effectiveness of AI-enhanced C2 interfaces:

|Criterion|Description|Example Metrics|
|---|---|---|
|Situational Awareness|How well does the interface keep operators informed about the real-time state of the battlespace?|- Time to detect & classify new entities<br>- Accuracy of threat & opportunity assessment<br>- % of mission-critical data displayed|
|Decision Support|To what extent does the interface aid operators in making timely, high-quality decisions?|- COA comparison cycle time<br>- Asset utilization rate<br>- Adherence to ROEs & CONOPS|
|Human-AI Collaboration|How seamlessly do human and AI agents work together to accomplish mission objectives?|- % of AI recommendations accepted<br>- Inter-agent communication efficiency<br>- Human trust in AI|
|Transparency & Explainability|Can operators understand and critically evaluate the rationale behind AI outputs?|- Mental model accuracy<br>- Failure prediction precision<br>- Human-AI shared awareness level|
|Adaptability|How flexibly does the interface adapt to changing mission needs and operator roles?|- Cross-role task performance<br>- Mission phase transition latency<br>- % of required UI customizations supported|

## Future Research Directions

While this report has laid out a solid foundation of design principles and evaluation criteria for AI-enhanced C2 interfaces, there remain many open questions and avenues for further investigation, such as:

- Developing standardized human-AI interaction design patterns for common C2 tasks and contexts
- Exploring computational approaches for automatically optimizing C2 interface layouts and workflows based on operator biometrics and interaction traces
- Defining formal methods for testing and certifying the joint human-AI system performance enabled by a given C2 interface under degraded and adversarial conditions
- Extending the design principles to encompass AR/VR modalities and mobile form factors for use by frontline warfighters
- Prototyping decentralized C2 interface architectures for enhanced resilience in communications-denied environments

Addressing these and other vital research challenges will be essential to fully realizing the transformative potential of human-AI collaboration in military command and control. The interfaces we design today will shape the conflicts of tomorrow.
