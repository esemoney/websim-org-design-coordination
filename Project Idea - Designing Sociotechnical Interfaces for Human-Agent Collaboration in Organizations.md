# Project Idea: Designing Sociotechnical Interfaces for Human-Agent Collaboration in Organizations

This project explores the design of interfaces and interactions that enable effective collaboration between human workers and AI agents within organizational contexts. The goal is to prototype an intuitive, accessible system that leverages the complementary strengths of humans and AI to enhance team performance on complex cognitive tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand key principles and challenges in human-agent teaming
- Apply user-centered design methods to sociotechnical systems
- Prototype an interface that facilitates fluid human-AI collaboration
- Evaluate the usability and effectiveness of AI-mediated teamwork tools

## Project Scenario

You are part of a UX team tasked with designing a collaborative work platform for a large consulting firm. The firm wants to augment its project teams with AI agents that can assist with research, analysis, ideation, and decision support. Your challenge is to design the human-agent interfaces and interactions for this system in a way that is intuitive, efficient, and promotes trust and shared understanding between human and AI collaborators.

### Functional Requirements

- Allow humans to delegate tasks to AI agents based on their capabilities
- Enable humans and AIs to jointly view and manipulate shared workspaces
- Provide features for humans to review and give feedback on AI outputs
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration modes

### Design Requirements

- Make agent capabilities and limitations transparent to human users
- Provide clear affordances for human-agent communication and handoffs
- Give humans ultimate control and ability to override agent actions
- Design for progressive trust-building as humans gain experience with AI
- Accommodate diverse user needs with customizable UI views and settings

### Technical Requirements

- Design in Figma with reusable components, styles, and responsive layouts
- Create an interactive prototype demonstrating key interactions and states
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines and test with assistive tech
- Document design decisions and rationale in accompanying design spec

## Suggested Approach

1. Research the specific activities and contexts where human-agent collaboration could provide value for consulting project teams.
2. Interview subject matter experts to understand workflows, pain points, and opportunities for AI augmentation.
3. Sketch initial concepts for the collaborative interface and review with project stakeholders.
4. Design key screens, components, and microinteractions in Figma, iterating based on feedback.
5. Develop an interactive prototype, supporting core collaboration scenarios in both desktop and mobile views.
6. Conduct usability testing with representative users, gathering insights to refine the UX.
7. Document the end-to-end user journey, design decisions, and next steps in a summary design spec.

## Project Deliverables

Design artifacts:

- User research insights and design requirements
- Figma files containing:
    - UI component library extending corporate design system for agent interactions
    - Key screens for 2-3 collaboration scenarios across device types
    - Interactive prototype of core user journeys
- Summary design specification deck with research insights, annotated wireframes, interaction notes, and next steps
