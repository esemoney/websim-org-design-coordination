# Professor's Detailed Notes on Course Methods & Tools:  
Theory, Practice and Simulation

Dear students,

Welcome to Course 4.601 on Sociotechnical Interfaces, Human-Agent Teaming and Human-Agent Collaboration in Organizations! I'm thrilled to have you join me in this exploration of one of the most consequential and fast-moving domains of our time. Over the course of the semester, we'll be working together to develop deep conceptual understandings, applied skills, and practical wisdom to navigate the complex challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as artificial intelligence increasingly reshapes the landscape of work and organizing.

In this extended note, I want to share an in-depth overview of the approach we'll be taking - spanning theory, practice, and simulation - and the powerful set of methods and tools we'll be leveraging along the way. My aim is to preview the arc of our inquiry, the logic behind the course design, and what you can expect to gain from engaging wholeheartedly in this learning experience. So let's dive in!

## Integrating Multiple Modes of Inquiry

A central premise of this course is that grasping the sociotechnical dynamics of human-AI collaboration requires weaving together multiple modes of inquiry. We need rigorous theory to provide conceptual clarity and generative frames. We need engaged practice to grapple with the contextual nuances and embedded challenges of real-world integration. And we need simulation and modeling to explore complex interaction dynamics, surface emergent phenomena, and prototype interventions. None of these is sufficient on its own, but together they form a potent triangle for making sense and making progress.

**Theory:** Anchored in seminal and cutting-edge research across disciplines like organizational studies, human-computer interaction, AI, and complex systems.

**Practice:** Engaged through deep case studies, reflective application projects, and dialogues with expert practitioners.

**Simulation:** Enabled by powerful computational tools for agent-based modeling, data visualization, and interactive systems prototyping.

We'll be constantly cycling between these modes throughout the course, using each to inform and enrich the others. You'll have the chance to engage with foundational theories, analyze evocative case studies, hear from leading practitioners, experiment with simulation models, and apply your learning in realistic project contexts. The goal is to cultivate a multi-faceted understanding that equips you to navigate real-world complexity with rigor and nuance.

## Building Blocks of the Course Experience

So what will this look like in practice? Let me break down some of the key building blocks of the course experience:

- **Interactive Lectures:** Our class sessions will combine short lectures to introduce key concepts with ample discussion and hands-on activities to deepen understanding. Come ready to engage, question, and co-create meaning together.
- **Case Studies:**Deep dives into real-world examples of organizations grappling with the challenges of human-AI collaboration, from early experiments to large-scale deployments. We'll dissect the sociotechnical dynamics at play and extract transferable insights.
- **Expert Panels:** Dialogues with leading practitioners across domains to hear first-hand accounts of the promises, pitfalls, and practices of integrating AI in organizational contexts. Bring your burning questions!
- **Hands-on Workshops:** Guided exploration of tools and techniques for agent-based modeling, data visualization, participatory design, and more. Get ready to get your hands dirty and build your skills through application.
- **Reflection Exercises:** Regular prompts to step back, synthesize, and critically examine your evolving understanding. The goal is to surface insights, puzzles, and connections across the readings, discussions, and experiences.
- **Team Projects:**A semester-long project where you'll work in teams to apply course concepts to a real-world human-AI collaboration challenge in partnership with an organization. This is a chance to integrate your learning and make a tangible impact.

Woven throughout all of these will be a spirit of critical inquiry, collaborative sensemaking, and grounded speculation. We'll constantly be asking: What seems to be going on here? What assumptions are at play? What alternative framings could we bring? What might we be missing? What could this make possible? How could we test that?

## A Multidisciplinary Toolkit

To support this multipronged inquiry, we'll be drawing on a rich set of conceptual and methodological tools from various fields. You'll gain both a theoretical grounding and practical fluency in areas like:

- Organizational theory and work design
- Human-computer interaction and UX
- AI/ML technologies and architectures
- Complex systems and computational modeling
- Ethnography and field research methods
- Design thinking and participatory design
- Futuring and speculative design

Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with some of these - the whole idea is to build your repertoire and stretch your thinking. I'll be providing plenty of guidance and resources along the way, and your diverse backgrounds and expertises as a cohort are a huge asset. We'll be learning with and from each other throughout.

**Key Tools & Platforms:**

- NetLogo & Mesa for agent-based modeling
- Observable & D3.js for data visualization
- Figma & Miro for interactive prototyping and participatory design
- Hugging Face & TensorFlow for AI/ML experimentation

As you engage with these tools and platforms, the goal is not just to develop technical proficiency, but to envision and enact new ways of combining technological and social possibilities. We'll be constantly reflecting on the affordances and limitations of our tools, and exploring how we could adapt and reconfigure them to unlock new insights and solutions.

## Co-Creating Our Learning Journey

Underpinning all of this is an ethos of co-creation and collective sensemaking. This course is not about passively absorbing a fixed body of knowledge, but about actively constructing meaning and pushing the boundaries of understanding together.

I've structured the course to provide a strong foundation and generative prompts, but where we go with it will emerge from your questions, ideas, and initiatives. I'll be looking to you to surface puzzles, challenge assumptions, make novel connections, and bring your unique perspectives to bear. Our classroom will be a space for earnest inquiry, respectful debate, and collaborative imagination.

We'll also have ample opportunities to learn from and with a broader community of scholars and practitioners. In addition to our guest panels, we'll be engaging in virtual dialogues with leading researchers, participating in workshops with partner organizations, and sharing our work for feedback and inspiration. The goal is to situate our learning within a vibrant ecosystem of inquiry and impact.

Ultimately, my role is to create the conditions for your growth and success. I'll be your guide, thought partner, and champion, but the real magic will come from your active engagement, bold thinking, and generous collaboration. I have no doubt that you will astound me with your insights, creativity, and drive.

I'm truly excited and honored to undertake this learning journey with you. Let's dive in with open minds, big questions, and a commitment to making a positive difference in the world. Together, we can shape the future of human-AI collaboration!

Onwards and upwards,
